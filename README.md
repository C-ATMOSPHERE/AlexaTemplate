# AlexaTemplate
This is a template for building well organized Alexa skills. It is based on the [Alexa.Net](https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet) nuget package.

# Setup
In order to create and develop Alexa skills with C# you will need to download the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). This will allow you to easily deploy the application as a lambda function on the AWS cloud platform. Keep in mind you will also need to create your skill and link it with the lambda function on the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).
